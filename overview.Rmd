title: "Exploring the Relationship Between Stress, Physical Activity, Gender, and Sleep Duration"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

**Motivation**
This project aims to highlight why sleep is important, and why predicting sleep duration from lifestyle factors matters.

**Main Questions**
Can we predict sleep duration from stress, physical activity, and gender?

**Supporting Questions**
- How does average sleep duration vary across gender
- Is there a correlation between physical activity and stress level?

**Notebook Goal**
This notebook focuses on data cleaning and exploratory analysis using R to prepare a dataset for resgression modeling in Python.


## Load Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dataset = read.csv("sleep_data.csv")
str(dataset)
is.na(dataset$Sleep.Duration)

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Target Variable: Sleep Duration
Predictors: Stress Level, Physical Activity, Gender
```{r}
avg_sleep_duration = mean(dataset$Sleep.Duration)

avg_quality_sleep = mean(dataset$Quality.of.Sleep)

avg_physical_activity = mean(dataset$Physical.Activity.Level)

averages = data.frame(
  Metrics = c("Avg. Sleep Duration (Hours)",
"Avg. Sleep Quality (0-10)", 
 "Avg. Physical Activity (0-100)"
),
Values = c(avg_sleep_duration, avg_quality_sleep, avg_physical_activity)
)
averages

#Plots 
hist(dataset$Sleep.Duration,
     main = "Sleep Duration",
     xlab = "Sleep in hours" )

duration_ByGender = dataset |> 
  select("Gender", "Sleep.Duration")

ggplot(duration_ByGender, 
       aes(x = Gender, y = Sleep.Duration,
           fill = Gender)) + geom_boxplot() + labs( title = "Sleep Duration By Gender",
        x = "Gender",
        y = "Sleep Duration (hours)"
           ) 
  
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = Stress.Level, y = Sleep.Duration)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Stress Level and Sleep Duration",
    x = "Stress Level",
    y = "Sleep Duration (hours)"
  )

cor_analysis = data.frame("Sleep Duration" = dataset$Sleep.Duration,
"Stress Level" =  dataset$Stress.Level, 
   "Physical Activity Level"= dataset$Physical.Activity.Level)

cor(cor_analysis)
